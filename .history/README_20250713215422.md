# Mini-Commerce

## 🛒 Project Overview
Mini-Commerce is a fully client-side e-commerce frontend built with Next.js 14 (App Router), React, Zustand, React Query, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to browse products, manage a cart, and complete a mock checkout flow — with persistent state via localStorage.

## 🎨 Design Approach
- *Responsive*: Mobile-first design using Tailwind grid/flex utilities.
- *Modern*: Clean layout, smooth transitions, and animations via AOS.
- *Dark Mode*: Toggle between light and dark themes using Tailwind’s dark classes.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- *Next.js 14* App Router (with app/ directory)
- *TypeScript* with strict: true
- *Zustand* for global cart state with persist
- *React Query* for fetching product catalogue
- *Tailwind CSS* for styling
- *Toast Notifications* using react-hot-toast
- *AOS* for scroll animations
- *SEO*: Meta tags, OpenGraph, and favicon
- *Extras*: Product filtering (by price + storage), Google Maps, WhatsApp contact, and cart icon badge

## 🧪 Testing
- At least 1 test with *Jest + React Testing Library*

## 🛠 Error Handling
- Error fallback for:
  - Failed product fetch
  - Missing product details
  - Broken routes (404 handling via not-found.tsx)
- Graceful loading UI

## 🔍 SEO Strategy
- <meta> tags and OpenGraph tags in layout.tsx
- og:image for social share previews
- Favicon added for brand recognition
